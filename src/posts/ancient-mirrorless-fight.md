Mirrorful cameras were unquestionable kings until mid 2010s. Mirrorless designs came in early 2010s and generally had a lot of catching up. The benefits were obvious to early adopters - in the form of adapters. But before Sony came out with a7ii, there were many drawbacks - crop sensors, slow autofocus, terrible screens (especially when comparing to optical viewfinders).

Now I have two of these early mirrorless cameras - the Fuji X-Pro1 and Oly PEN E-PL2. One represents the high end, the other - mid-low. How do they compare? Are they still usable in $current_year?

# Fujifilm X-Noob1

By a stroke of luck, I got my hands on an X-Pro1 a while ago. I used it as a secondary camera to my X-S10, thanks to the same lens mount, for gigs, or when I felt like using it, for a different experience.

It was a neat camera in some ways and I understand the charm, but it came with few serious problems that made me use it less and less. Obvious one was autofocus, which was terribly slow, and shutter delay was massive. Absolutely useless for street photography. Another - the hybrid viewfinder showing the frame is cool, but the frame doesn't match the photo. Almost worse than a Zenit.

Third was the screens - the main screen has terrible angles, slow refresh rate, and low resolution. Using the electronic viewfinder is almost preferable, except when you're using a manual lens with focus peaking - the resolution is even worse, and when something is almost in focus, the whole screen will turn red, and it's very difficult to tell if it's focused or not.

But again. I get the charm. It's neat to hold. Dials are satisfying. It's just not very pleasant to use after the initial enchantment.

# Olympus PENcil E-PL2

And by another stroke of luck I got my hands of a long unused E-PL2. There's no viewfinder to speak of, so there's less to complain about. It also employs a contrast-detect based autofocus system, but unlike X-Pro1, it has 4-EV IBIS, supposedly.

Had to replace the grip with some fake leather and clean the sensor. The lens has some fungus I can't really deal with, but I'm okay with it.

The problems? Well, it's a M43 sensor with 12MP resolution. It's not as suitable for adapting as APS-C is, unless you're into birding.

And birding is the photographic equivalent of fishing. You stand still for hours, supposedly waiting for the perfect moment, but in reality just to get away from the wife.

It's lighter and smaller than the X-Pro, and it still feels relatively good to hold. There's not many dials to play with here - there's the mode dial and everything else is controlled by the dials and buttons in the back. Certainly not as easy to control for an advanced photographer as the other, but will still get the job done. Most of the time you only need to change the aperture, and that's easy.

# Image quality

I am testing it with the kit lens, at f8, at wide (28mm equivalent), medium (50mm), and long distances, at lowest ISO, with the view from my window. I also include X-S10 for reference, to see how far have we gone.

# Dynamic range

Here's a contrasty scene. These were shot in RAW, and in Lightroom shadows were set to +100, and highlights got -100.

# Autofocus speed

I did mention X-Pro1 was terrible at it earlier. But how does it compare?

In practice, X-Pro1 was almost unusable in any fast-changing environment, including street photography. The shot would be already long done by the time the shutter did its job. E-PL2 is... // test, insert conclusions

# Still worth picking up?

No.
