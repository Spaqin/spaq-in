Have you found yourself lucky enough to visit the Asia's ~~World~~ China City? Do you shoot film, or just wanna get some cheap gear? I have some tips for you. There's a lot of small shops you'll find in HK, but not all of them are honest or worth your time.

That doesn't mean I know every place in there, but I do have some recommendations. There's a caveat though - I do not specialize in reddot. The list was also written in September of 2025; things can change rapidly in this city, so keep that in mind.

# Film

For film shooters, this place is a paradise. So many wet markets with angry uncles smoking cigs next to the food their sell; people in the metro disinterested in life and counting seconds to weekend; stunning landscapes and easily reachable landmarks. And cheap, quick turnaround labs, with high end gear readily available. Finally free of Smenas and Zenits.

## Gear

My honest advise is to avoid any camera shop on the ground level. Scammy, overpriced, somehow have to make up the insane rent rates.

You can also find some gear on Apliu Street in Sham Shui Po (or the other side, I never remember). Cameras and lenses there usually in poor condition; you can have a look to kill time, at least it won't be that overpriced most of the time.

### Sim City

Sim City would be the one place to point for any gear. There are few shops that specialize in film gear, and plenty carry both analog and digital. One specific reddot shop, one that carries rare stuff, few shops for film. They follow the trends quite quickly, so if one thing becomes popular, sooner or later all the shops will carry the fad, but their core will remain.

For modern digital gear, that's also where I got myself pretty much everything; the Fujis, the Nikons. Plenty of shops, some with used goods, some with new, some with parallel import (imported from countries where it's even cheaper than HK, meaning lower price but no international warranty).

Have a look around the three floors, and if you're looking for something specific, don't be afraid to ask, the sellers are usually quite friendly and not bad with English. You can sometimes haggle a little, and if you pay by card they'll usually add 3% extra fee.

### HKCamera

A small shop in Tsim Sha Tsui, one-man operation. He's got a good sample of higher end cameras at often competitive prices; that's where I bought my Widelux and Canon P. You can test the camera out easily before you decide on it, and he'll throw in a free roll of film and development.

Besides that you can go there to get a roll of film; prices aren't best but the choices are good, and the location is very convenient for tourists.

He also does in-house development of black and white and C-41, but only with scans; not much use for me as I prefer to scan myself. However, if you do choose him, you'll get the scans in 2 hours.

### Sunrise Photo

That's a bit of an oddball in Sham Shui Po. It carries normal lenses at decent price; some cheaper point and shoots. And they have a whole row of TLRs, probably the most exciting part of this. I got my Minolta 100mm f2.5 there and generally the seller is blunt, but honest. Prices were alright. Visit if you're in the area, but I wouldn't make a special trip just to there.

## Labs

I would like to point out that I scan film myself. I do not have any information on turnaround when scans are involved. I also develop black and white film at home.

Lab quality isn't really a concern - color processes are both standardized and I've never had a problem with wildly off colors. When people discuss lab quality (or liking one over the other) they most often refer to scans, which I deem irrelevant in my case.

### CameraFilmPhoto

Located in Lai Chi Kok, and hidden on the 5th floor of an industrial building, Camera Film Photo is my favorite place. If I have a batch of film especially; it's not particularly close to anything (Sham Shui Po, I guess?), so it's not worth visiting with one roll, unless you're pressed for time.

For sale they also have plenty of film; prices may vary but the choices are diverse. Development price is the lowest across all HK and their turnaround is impressive:

* C-41 will take 1 hour. Usually less.
* E-6 will take *at most* 1 day. If you come early enough, you might get it on the same day.

The E-6 situation is what really pulls me there. Every other shop will take a week or two to develop your slides as they send it out; so it makes sense to save yourself the time and go there directly. You can also pay with cash, Octopus or credit card.

### TrueFace

Located in Mong Kok, this tiny shop has a much more convenient location. In house they only do C-41 at a bit higher price than CFP. However, they make it up with 30 minute development time. You can easily go there, walk around Sim City, Pet Street or get some quick food, and go back to grab your negs. However if you do that, don't let them stay too long - I almost never get a receipt, so I rely on my gweilo face being unique enough so they know which negatives are mine.

You can pay with cash or PayMe only.

### Colorluxe Express

Located between Wan Chai and Causeway Bay, it's the only real option on Hong Kong Island. That's for the lazy situations. The price isn't best, and they take often over 3 hours for C-41. The clerks aren't most honest either if you have any non-standard requests, but I'll still go there if I have no other option.

They take cash, Octopus and credit cards.

# Digital

## CCD cameras

The misunderstanding of the photo taking is thankfully concentrated in Sham Shui Po area. Expect the places to be crowded at all times with mostly big6 customers.

### Sham Shui Po street market

From Exit C, turn right. You'll find it easily. There's a proper shop also behind it. Smaller embassy of CCD is in one of the alleys as well. Generally if you walk around, you're bound to find something.

### New Computer Plaza

Now this one's a bit hidden. There's also some film gear, and I've seen Horseman lenses as well, weirdly enough?

From the corner entrance, walk upstairs to the first floor. The main shop is more or less behind you, but few other shops are also located on this floor. You will probably get lost, the mall is not unlike a maze, but the selection of goods is okay; not my first place to go, but if I'm in the area, I can still check it out.

## Normal gear

Besides aforementioned Sim City, there are few shops here and there that are hard to recommend; usually they focus on higher end like MeteorHK, or film like Showa. 

# Internet

## Carousell

That's the place I usually use for my sales. Listings are free, and both English and Chinese are supported. Just contact the seller, and decide on which MTR station to meet at; simple enough.

## DCFever

This Chinese only site is a place with news, reviews and forums, and it also has a place for trading second hand goods; not only cameras. However, it's in Chinese only.

## Taobao

How can I not mention it? That's the marketplace for mainland China; if you want to get a new Chinese lens, that's closest to the source. However that doesn't mean it's the cheapest - I found some lenses in Sim City for less than the Taobao price.

## Price.com.hk

It's a price comparison site, and it does list the shops and whatnot, but it doesn't deal with sales directly. Contact the shops to ask if they really have the thing you want in stock - they usually don't.

# Repair

What if your camera breaks? There are few local repairmen, but I only tried two that I can really recommend.

## Camera Repair Centre Ltd (TST)

Located in Friend's House in Tsim Sha Tsui, it's a bunch of older guys who aren't particularly nice or are particularly great with English, but that's okay; they know their shit.

They fixed my Hexar RF (twice) at a reasonable rate; not particularly cheap, but not outrageous either. They seem to work on both analog and digital cameras, but to what extent I cannot be sure.

## Panda Camera Repair Service

An older gentleman in Central that has a lovely studio and a passion for analog equipment (but nothing remotely digital). Except for Bronica. No one has the passion (or parts) to fix these.

Still though, with a minor language barrier, he was very happy to clean my Widelux inside and out.
