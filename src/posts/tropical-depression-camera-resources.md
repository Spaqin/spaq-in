Have you found yourself lucky enough to visit the Asia's ~~World~~ China City? Do you shoot film, or just wanna get some cheap gear? I have some tips for you. There's a lot of small shops you'll find in HK, but not all of them are honest or worth your time.

That doesn't mean I know every place in there, but I do have some recommendations. There's a caveat though - I do not specialize in reddot. The list was also written in September of 2025; things can change rapidly in this city, so keep that in mind.

# Film

For film shooters, this place is a paradise. So many wet markets with angry uncles smoking cigs next to the food their sell; people in the metro disinterested in life and counting seconds to weekend; stunning landscapes and easily reachable landmarks. And cheap, quick turnaround labs, with high end gear readily available. Finally free of Smenas and Zenits.

## Gear

My honest advise is to avoid any camera shop on the ground level. Scammy, overpriced, somehow have to make up the insane rent rates.

You can also find some gear on Apliu Street in Sham Shui Po (or the other side, I never remember). Cameras and lenses there usually in poor condition; you can have a look to kill time, at least it won't be that overpriced most of the time.

### Sim City

The biggest camera mall in Mong Kok is about the only place I'd recommend if you have limited time. There are 2 or 3 bigger shops that focus on film; maybe 2 more that specialize in reddot. Besides that, there's one shop that sells only film; that's where I'd go for my Instax needs as the price is usually the lowest as well.

Sellers are usually friendly, but won't bullshit you. Have a look at the lenses thoroughly before you buy.

### HKCamera

A small shop in Tsim Sha Tsui, one-man operation. He's got a good sample of higher end cameras at often competitive prices; that's where I bought my Widelux and Canon P. You can test the camera out easily before you decide on it, and he'll throw in a free roll of film and development.

Besides that you can go there to get a roll of film; prices aren't best but the choices are good, and the location is very convenient for tourists.

He also does in-house development of black and white and C-41, but only with scans; so I rarely use him. However, if you do, you'll get the scans in 2 hours.

### Sunrise Photo

That's a bit of an oddball in Sham Shui Po. It carries normal lenses at decent price; some cheaper point and shoots. I got my Minolta 100mm f2.5 there and generally the seller is blunt, but honest. Prices were alright.

## Labs

I would like to point out that I scan film myself. I do not have any information on turnaround when scans are involved. I also develop black and white film at home.

Lab quality isn't really a concern - color processes are both standardized and I've never had a problem with wildly off colors. When people discuss lab quality (or liking one over the other) they most often refer to scans, which I deem irrelevant in my case.

### CameraFilmPhoto

Located in Lai Chi Kok, and hidden on the 5th floor of an industrial building, Camera Film Photo is my favorite place. If I have a batch of film especially; it's not particularly close to anything (Sham Shui Po, I guess?), so it's not worth visiting with one roll, unless you're pressed for time.

For sale they also have plenty of film; prices may vary but the choices are diverse. Development price is the lowest across all HK and their turnaround is impressive:

* C-41 will take 1 hour. Usually less.
* E-6 will take *at most* 1 day. If you come early enough, you might get it on the same day.

The E-6 situation is what really pulls me there. Every other shop will take a week or two to develop your slides as they send it out; so it makes sense to save yourself the time and go there directly. You can also pay with cash, Octopus or credit card.

### TrueFace

Located in Mong Kok, this tiny shop has a much more convenient location. In house they only do C-41 at a bit higher price than CFP. However, they make it up with 30 minute development time. You can easily go there, walk around Sim City or get some quick food, and go back to grab your negs.

You can pay with cash or PayMe only.

### Colorluxe Express

Located between Wan Chai and Causeway Bay, it's the only real option on Hong Kong Island. That's for the lazy situations. The price isn't best, and they take often over 3 hours for C-41. The clerks aren't most honest either if you have any non-standard requests, but I'll still go there if I have no other option.

They take cash, Octopus and credit cards.

# Digital

## CCD cameras

The misunderstanding of the photo taking is thankfully concentrated in Sham Shui Po area. Expect the places to be crowded at all times with mostly big6 customers.

### Sham Shui Po street market

From Exit C, turn right. You'll find it easily. There's a proper shop also behind it. Smaller embassy of CCD is in one of the alleys as well. Generally if you walk around, you're bound to find something.

### New Computer Plaza

Now this one's a bit hidden. There's also some film gear, and I've seen Horseman lenses as well, weirdly enough?

From the corner entrance, walk upstairs to the first floor. The main shop is more or less behind you, but few other shops are also located on this floor. You will probably get lost, the mall is not unlike a maze, but the selection of goods is quite good.
