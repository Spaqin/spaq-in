I mentioned something about the opportunities. Through an incredible stroke of bad and good luck, you may meet good people; and the good people may want to gift you a dry box, to storage your equipment in an unforgivingly humid climate. And that dry box, while used, may come with plethora of other equipment... including a mint Canon EOS 30.

# I have become what I despise... a Canon shooter

I'm a sucker for free cameras. Obviously. But I'm also a bit of a contrarian hipster - thus being a Minolta fanboy, shitposting about RB67 being superior to Pentax 67 online, or getting a Canon P over Leica M3 (price has nothing to do with it guys!!). Nikon has its merits, kind of - although I didn't like the F much, and the new ones didn't speak to me at all. But... Canon? You mean the company that made AE-1, budget camera that got overhyped on YouTube? Or the new digital ones, that are used by boomers and wedding photographers? Or the guys who made my dad's 700D which is awful in more ways than I can count? The P was alright, but that was a looong time ago. Canon glass isn't even that good, guys!

But when I got the 30 in my hands... with the additional grip, that is, but without a lens - well, I was intrigued. Figured the legend must have come from something, and despite not being a flagship, it felt good. I mean, free camera in great state, with the remote to boot. Worst case, I'll flip it, make an easy profit, right? The rubbers are a bit sticky, but a quick clean with isopropyl alcohol alleviated that.

One problem though - I suppose from the age, the door latch has broke off. I could not close the door anymore. Getting a legit part seemed impossible, but it's a common enough issue that some smart guy designed a 3d printable version. My good coworker has printed few for me, and in an hour I replaced it. So if I'm selling it, I can say it's been repaired recently too, right? That's a good point.

I ventured online, and found a 50mm f1.8 USM II for 250HKD, in box with papers. Not a huge investment in the slightest, surely I could flip the lens itself for more than I bought it for.

The reality was dawning on me. If you could see the horror on my face, when I had the realization that if I don't control myself, I may actually become a Canon shooter. Step by step, I was getting closer...

# Actual review

Although big and black, it's sleek. You put your hand around the grip, and it feels like it always belonged there. You move it up and down, left and right, and despite its weight, you control it with ease. You gasp while switching the dials and pressing buttons, as they also give a nice sound.

It's not a flagship camera, and yet it feels like one. Released in 2000, at the end of the film era, it's packed with features you didn't know you needed. It runs on two CR123A batteries - or with the vertical grip, on 4 AAs. It adds to the heft, but also to the convenience - CR123As aren't *that* easy to find and they're quite pricy. I'd rather load it up with 4 LADDAs from IKEA and recharge when necessary.

# All around, it's pretty complicated.

Front of the camera reveals a front dial, shutter button, DoF preview button, lens release button and of course the lens mount, hungry for some thick glass. Someone more observant will also notice that there's also an on-camera flash, a light for red eye reduction, and an IR receiver, for the remote. So although the shutter button is flat and you won't be able to screw in your $1 cable, you can use the remote for your self pleasuring needs.

I'm not gonna go through all the menus and screen

# Interface

Lots of buttons etc etc

power button on the left sucks

rear dial seems counterintuitive a bit (sometimes it does things sometimes it doesn't)

# Mind reading autofocus!

Eye AF is based af

# No one cares!



# Glass and image quality

The 50mm f1.8 is cheap and light. It doesn't leave the best impression, but... I can't complain about the images at all. I don't have an adapter to Fuji (probably would get Viltrox EF-FX MK1 without the speedbooster - contact me if you wanna sponsor it :)) to check the sharpness with other 50s I have, but it's really not bad at all. It's a simple construction, but it works well. Autofocus is a bit

I also bought two more lenses. Investing into a system that I was intending to flip...? Hmmmmm...

One is a Vivitar Series 1 18-35mm f3.5-4.5, new old stock, with the box. An older ultrawide to wide zoom can't be good, but on film it's not bad at all. I'm sure if I tried it on digital, I'd see how bad it is. Too bad it's champagne color, rather than black, but eh. It's dark, sure, but it's quite light.

The second is a 70-210mm f4-5.6 USM IS II. I really wanted image stabilization. It's great on my digital Fuji, and I had plenty of blurry photos with a telephoto (but then also I had some surprisingly sharp ones!) to know it's better to have it. It's not that expensive, although I ordered it from Japan - around 1100HKD. And yes, the image stabilization works! I was considering a cheaper Tamron, but because the Canon lens protocols are not open, it's got issues with older, film bodies. Annoying. Either way, I was very happy with the quality of the images from that lens, and with the image stabilization I can get down to 1/10. It's a big piece of black tube, it's bigger than anything I currently have, and the only lens that doesn't fit vertically in my dry box.

# Conclusions

is good
