This is it.

Hello, world. (_world_: Helloo, _spaqin_)

It's working, and it's quite a spectacle. But I'm sure it took less work than this fountain light show in Dadepo Beach in Busan.

I'm a big boy now. I bought my own domain, and I'm hosting a web page I wrote by myself in Gatsby. I mean, I used a tutorial, and modified some bits.

Still, not too bad. Not something I'd like to do often, but seems easy enough once grapsed that modifications aren't a pain in the butt.

Of course, the site was set up for no reason in particular; not looking for clout, or to make the world listen to my opinions on the most mundane minutia. Thus, old camera reviews are in order - something as pointless as it can ever be.

Or political manifestos. If you don't fit in the world, or the world doesn't fit your tastes, make it so! Preferably non-violently, though.

Anyway, the entire point of this post is to check if everything's working. There's absolutely no value here to be had.
