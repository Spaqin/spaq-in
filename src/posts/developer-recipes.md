The infromation is slowly disappearing from the net. The other day I realized I cannot find the recipe for D-76d I've been using! So there's not much choice but to gather it myself and publish it, before it disappears again. The recipes here are gathered from different places, and I don't want to double the information you can find on [DigitalTruth](https://www.digitaltruth.com/data.php?doc=filmdevsabc). If you have any that are missing and could be rare, or if you have any remarks, feel free to [contact](/contact) me to update this page.

Mostly, developers similar to D-76 and its variations will be included.

*Author's note*: I actually used this one a fair bit. In general, use D76 times plus 50% (yes, fifty percent longer development). 1L is good for 10 rolls without replenishing, but do increase dev time by 10% on 5th roll and 10% on next rolls.

# D89 (Alternative)

[Source.](https://project-double-x.com/developer-formulas/)

Compared to D76, it should give less base fog (thanks to potassium bromide). Hydroquinone seems unnecessary, and so does Pinacryptol, compared to the previous recipe. This is probably easier to make.

Gives sharper results than D-76, with 10-20% longer development times. Full film speed.

*Author's Note*: I am keeping an eye on this one, I may actually give it a try and post a review of sorts. Just need to get my hands on potassium bromide.
