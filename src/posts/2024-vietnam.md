Still having some annual leave left, I decided to go for a weeklong trip to Vietnam. That's one destination I've heard great things about - the food, the views; HK can be stifling too, so it was a break I really was looking forward to. Let's see what I have learned from this trip.

# Original itinerary and expectations

Well, I didn't plan this trip well and kind of scrambled to get everything within one week, so I didn't plan much.

Basically, Hanoi and Saigon. Originally I wanted to take the train between the two, 36 hours, but finally decided against, to have more time for myself, and money - the plane was cheaper. I did want to take a long train ride once in my life finally, but this was not the right moment. _I'll take the transsiberian at some point for sure._

I didn't think much about what I'll be doing there either. In my head Vietnam means jungle, and rice fields on the mountains. And white backpackers. It seemed like a place with a lot of history, including colonial, so I assumed that I'd get to see some historical artifacts and colonial buildings. Simple as. Eat great food, don't strand too far from the cities, it will be alright. Sunday morning to Thursday in Hanoi, Thursday to Sunday in Saigon.

# What did I take?

## Backpack

I packed one backpack... a new backpack: the **Wandrd Prvke 21L**. I already have a Tenba Axis 24L, but it's a fully photographic backpack - you can't really make space for clothes or anything. The Prvke has a dedicated camera compartment - yes it's smaller - but a whole bunch of space on top. And many little side pockets, including two that I would call "stealthy", or pickpocket resistant: one in the back, and one on the bottom.

Then, a little side bag, an Adidas one I got from a friend. Nothing special about it, except that it's light and small, and helped take me few extra things

## Photo gear

* Fujifilm X-S10
* 2 extra batteries
* Fujinon XF 18-55 2.8-4
* Fujinon XC 50-230 4.5-6.3
* Viltrox 13mm f1.4
* Viltrox 33mm f1.4
* Fujica GS645S
* Bunch of Provia 100, Velvia 100

Fuji X-S10 is still the smaller choice, and the smarter one I'd say. Then a whole bunch of lenses: the classic 18-55 and 50-230 to cover most daytime traveling, Viltrox 13mm f1.4 for wides, and finally decided to take the Viltrox 33mm f1.4 out, for low light scenarios.

And GS645S is my favorite travel film camera. This time it also did its job great.

Oh and the Ulanzi F35 mount - absolutely great thing to have, to free up your hands.

No drone though - not for the lack of space, I'd surely find some, but rather stricter than usual laws. Since I planned to stay in the cities mostly, I didn't wanna bother either.

## Other things

Other things to mention: Galaxy Buds 2 Pro - great for airplanes or rare cases where you want to listen to music. Beats the Moondrop Golden Ages that I unfortunately lost back in Montreal.

UTorch UT01 - flashlight that has been with me everywhere. It's small, and so even if it doesn't get much use, I don't mind carrying it. I didn't use it after all, but I wouldn't leave it either.

Worst thing though? I forgot to bring my powerbank. As I've heard that pickpocketing can still be common, I took my old phone (Mi 9T) out with awful battery life; the powerbank would have been really useful. Just got a special Vietnam SIM card for data, moved my communicator apps and installed **Grab**. Very important, more on that later.

Additionally, I took some clothes that I would throw out anyway, with the goal of purchasing new touristy t-shirts in Vietnam. Could be a valid strategy.

# Departure

Just remember that Vietnam is not a visa-free country. Getting a visa is quite straightforward though - if you follow the official website. It may take few days, and without the confirmation you won't be able to fly; there doesn't seem to be a visa-on-arrival scheme anymore, at least for Polish citizens.

The flight from Hong Kong was not very long and the HK Express staff thankfully did not check the weight of my backpack (no check-in). Whew.

Without much delay I landed on Sunday, early morning in...

# Hanoi

From the plane you could see it's a vast city, but with no mountains or seas. The landscape photographer in me was already getting disappointed. But I've still heard good things about food, attractions, atmosphere; what's worth seeing?

The airport is quite far from the city. You can take a Grab, that would cost around 200-250k VND; metro buses (supposedly cheaper), or the special airport bus number 86 - that's 45k VND, that goes to the center (Old Quarters). Cash only. You just get in and the driver will approach you to get his share. Things seemed confusing at first, but there's a worldwide rule...

_If you're not sure how to pay/is a thing paid, just do what seems natural and remember that someone will ask for the money in one way or another. Let them come. Don't seek out._

Works everywhere. In a foreign country, without knowing the language? Hand gestures for money are pretty much universal.

## Train street

A lovely little tourist attraction - train tracks with cafes next to it. Having landed early and yearning coffee, I went with that recommendation at first, with train schedule saying that it would come in one and half hours. Since I came early I had enough time to walk around and pick a cafe. They all have very similar prices, so pick one that you like best.

The cafes are well decorated; feel free to take some pictures in the tracks, or of the hawkers that constantly go back and forth offering cheap trinkets at inflated prices.

Zippos made to look like they were left by American soldiers are still popular too. One hawker was particularly invasive, despite showing no interest (I like my lights electronic, thanks). I told him I don't smoke.

_I don't care!_

Well, me neither.

Ordered an egg coffee and bun cha; total about 120k. Coffee was made on site, food came from outside. In the last 30 minutes, the cafes got quite full. You do have to order something to get a seat. Fair enough.

In the last minutes before the train comes, tables and chairs are moved to the very edge of the street. The train is wide, and it comes very close, and quite fast. And it's not short either. Don't stick your hand in there, and you'll be fine; definitely not something you would see in any other place.

The crowd disperses rather quickly after the train; you can take your time before you leave.

Recommended as a side attraction.

## Hoan Kien lake

I took my sweet time at the hotel, without any particular destination in mind. The hotel was in the Old Quarters, with plenty of dining options nearby. After a nap I went out to the other big thing on the map: the lake. Grabbed a banh mi on the way; cilantro, pate, warm baguette, 25k, awesome.

On Sundays (and I think on Saturdays), the whole area is closed to traffic. People walk around, play badmintion; plenty of hawkers around; ladies selling small doughnut balls from a wheeled cart. Approached one with slight curiosity; haven't had a tiny doughnut since Poland.

_How much?_

She's already packing, and counting.

_See? It's good. One, two..._

_...how much?_

_...ten. 150k pls._

My eyes went wide. Do I look American?

_lol, lmao even._

_Then how much would you give me?_

Being realistic; snack in a tourist spot? Let's be generous.

_20k._

_lol, lmao even._

I turn back, she screams _we go half! 75!_, but I just kept on going, knowing there's no way to get to a reasonable deal from here. Haven't tried the doughnuts after all during my stay.

The lake doesn't seem to be too very nice; there's a little temple there on the island. Water ain't clear, and I wasn't lucky with the weather.

I got approached by some students who wanted to practice English. There's no scam around it; they come with a list of questions they want to ask. If they're half decent at English already you can have a lovely conversation with them, and you can learn a bit more about Vietnam from them too, so it's not a one-sided conversation. Find out some destinations, or food to try that you might've missed otherwise. However, if their English isn't good they won't tell you much, expecting a set response.

Little kids may approach you too.

_What is this?_ - a six year old said while pointing at my Fuji GS645S on a strap, and putting his hands on it already. Aha. Nothing happened, but a reminder to stay vigilant.

I didn't let it go as it is my favorite film travel camera, but there was no harm in letting them touch a piece of technology they will probably never see again.

Around the lake there's few cafes, so if you're caffeine starved, you won't be for long. Coffee is good, plentiful, and cheap; they're definitely proud of it. There's also a Mixue if you want cheap ice cream. Uniqlo in a stylized colonial building, main police station and old Ha Noi Moi newspaper building.

## Ngoc Son temple and interlude on traffic

Temple on the lake. Frankly, nothing special (after visting countless Asian temples), besides the lit up red bridge at night. Not worth the 50k entrance fee, but you can't get on the bridge without paying, so if you want a photo there, go for it.

I had my next destination in mind already - a funky little bar, a bit further from the centre. And it's impossible not to notice the traffic; infamous worldwide. Roads full of scooters. Roughly one per person in the whole country, of course. Traffic lights are merely a suggestion, and it all seems chaotic, and yet everyone gets to their destination safely. Including pedestrians crossing the streets. The constant honking is to let another driver know that they're being passed, not an angry honk. Motorists actually generally seem to be pretty chill with being cut off; getting to your destination is more important than pride.

Crossing is not not easy, but there are few ways you can work your way through it. Easiest if you see a local crossing the street, just stick to them; or another tourist, but they may need some extra encouraging. Keep your eyes at the incoming scooters, don't do any suddent movements that may end up with them crashing into you... and they will flow around you.

Just remember that cars won't.

## The Hanoi Social Club

Certainly a shoutout to a lovely [bar](https://g.co/kgs/iA1cm8r). I'm a sucker for their colonial decor, and while the venue isn't big, it certainly has a lot of charm. It was a slow evening, so a waiter kept me company and we had a lovely chat. It seems to be a favorite topic of the Vietnamese towards tourists - the traffic; I've heard that a lot. Paraphrasing:

_We all get safely from A to B. It's like a math problem in high school; sometimes you get the answer right, but the method may be wrong._

_You know, in Hong Kong you have the order, and laws, but you still have accidents. Here you have chaos, but everyone gets to their destination safely._

Remembering how annoying the HK traffic is, how inept (if not old) taxi drivers are, and how no one will move their car off to the side after the most minor fender bender... yeah, I think I prefer the chaos.

They have some pasta choices and decent beer in the menu which were alright, but one item in the menu stood out to me: the _Pho cocktail._ Generally I like weird tasting, savory cocktails, but I didn't dare the first time around. I came back the next day, over a promise of live music, and that the waiter told me that I should get real pho first, so I can compare the taste. The cocktail recipe was purchased from a guy who made it up in 2019 and won an award; it seemed exciting, worth the 180k price.

Live music was alright; a fella playing most known songs on guitar. Pho cocktail looked like pho. With coriander in the glass, and chili and limes on the side. The smell was incredible. Like pho. The taste... was kinda bland and sweet? Is it how it's supposed to be?

// insert the pic of the cocktail

Not too long later I was asked how is it. Usually people don't like being asked "how's the food", especially in a social setting - they want to enjoy their company, so they throw "it's good" and leave it at that. Since I was not in a social setting, but chilling on my own, I tried to describe the taste.

Quickly it turned out that _something was wrong in the way it's made_ - it's not supposed to be sweet; and I would get it remade. It took them a while and couldn't find the issue; so I got something else instead... and later they came back to me with a newly made pho cocktail. And this time it was it - it tasted like the soup. Savory, with that coriander note. Bit sour, and definitely not as sweet. Got a discount after all too. How long was it being made wrong? Can't say, if previous customers wouldn't go into detail on describing the drink... the smell was right after all. So a life lesson, to not be afraid to speak up when things seem wrong.

## Temple of Literature

A historical relic, to point out the 1000+ year old history of Vietnam. One of the first places in the city, a place for scholars. There's plenty of history there, including the temple that is featured on the 100k banknote. Technically - nothing special or spectacular, but if you want to learn a bit more about the history of Vietnam, it's a good starting point.

## Hoa Lo prison

From the English-curious students from the first day, I learned that they have a special show at night there. I went there the first day in the evening, after finding vague information that it's on weekends after 19:00. However, I was met with a closed gate, and few posters; I could not find any detailed information online on ticketing, in English especially. The QR code on the posters led me to a Vietnamese [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/hoaloprisonrelic/), seemed like it was a "DM me for details" thing in Vietnamese only. The shows are only on Friday and Saturday, so I haven't missed any, and the tickets were quite pricy.

## Ho Chi Minh mausoleum

// mention dress code, long queue, short visit, weird feeling, chat with a random Vietnamese couple

## Ha Long Bay daytrip

// not worth comparing to Philippines

## Beer street/Ma May street and other things to mention

// too old for this shit, scams

// museum of history, cathedral

# Saigon

_It's not Saigon, it's Ho Chi Minh City!_

_The people from there, they try so hard to be American!_

From a conversation with someone definitely pro-Communist while waiting at the mausoleum.

## Plane to
