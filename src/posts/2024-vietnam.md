Still having some annual leave left, I decided to go for a weeklong trip to Vietnam. That's one destination I've heard great things about - the food, the views; HK can be stifling too, so it was a break I really was looking forward to. Let's see what I have learned from this trip.

# Original itinerary and expectations

Well, I didn't plan this trip well and kind of scrambled to get everything within one week, so I didn't plan much.

Basically, Hanoi and Saigon. Originally I wanted to take the train between the two, 36 hours, but finally decided against, to have more time for myself, and money - the plane was cheaper. I did want to take a long train ride once in my life finally, but this was not the right moment. _I'll take the transsiberian at some point for sure._

I didn't think much about what I'll be doing there either. In my head Vietnam means jungle, and rice fields on the mountains. And white backpackers. It seemed like a place with a lot of history, including colonial, so I assumed that I'd get to see some historical artifacts and colonial buildings. Simple as. Eat great food, don't strand too far from the cities, it will be alright. Sunday morning to Thursday in Hanoi, Thursday to Sunday in Saigon.

# What did I take?

## Backpack

I packed one backpack... a new backpack: the **Wandrd Prvke 21L**. I already have a Tenba Axis 24L, but it's a fully photographic backpack - you can't really make space for clothes or anything. The Prvke has a dedicated camera compartment - yes it's smaller - but a whole bunch of space on top. And many little side pockets, including two that I would call "stealthy", or pickpocket resistant: one in the back, and one on the bottom.

Then, a little side bag, an Adidas one I got from a friend. Nothing special about it, except that it's light and small, and helped take me few extra things

## Photo gear

* Fujifilm X-S10
* 2 extra batteries
* Fujinon XF 18-55 2.8-4
* Fujinon XC 50-230 4.5-6.3
* Viltrox 13mm f1.4
* Viltrox 33mm f1.4
* Fujica GS645S
* Bunch of Provia 100, Velvia 100

Fuji X-S10 is still the smaller choice, and the smarter one I'd say. Then a whole bunch of lenses: the classic 18-55 and 50-230 to cover most daytime traveling, Viltrox 13mm f1.4 for wides, and finally decided to take the Viltrox 33mm f1.4 out, for low light scenarios.

And GS645S is my favorite travel film camera. This time it also did its job great.

Oh and the Ulanzi F35 mount - absolutely great thing to have, to free up your hands.

No drone though - not for the lack of space, I'd surely find some, but rather more strict laws. Since I planned to stay in the cities mostly, I didn't wanna bother either.
