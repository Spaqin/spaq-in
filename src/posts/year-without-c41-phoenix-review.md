"C-41 is digital with extra steps". If you look hard enough, you'll probably see me somewhere saying that. To prove my point, I decided that in 2023 I will not buy any color negative film. How did it go?

But at the end of 2023 though Harman has released Phoenix - its 200 ISO color film, a new color emulsion in a long time that's not from Kodak or Fuji. I was really tempted, but I stayed strong in my convictions, and bought a roll only in January 2024. That would be a nice end for the challenge, I thought. Was that worth it?

# C-41 makes me feel numb

Color negative was a necessity in film-only times thanks to its color capabilities (duh) and high dynamic range. For that purpose it makes perfect sense. That's why disposables were loaded with color film. A fully analog path with RA-4 prints also exists and the images could be perfect in a darkroom.

In the current days though? Let's see the competition: 

* Black and white can be done fully at home, with self-development; darkroom prints also relatively easy, if you have the space. For larger formats, cyanotype contact prints are also super simple, and fun.

* E-6 produces beautiful slides that are a joy to look at, give great colors when scanned. Pricy, both in film and development; not easy to develop in a small home either.

* Instant film: only for compatible medium and large format cameras. Usually not as good as slide, and more expensive, but immediately produce a physical artifact that you can hand out.

C-41? Not easy to develop at home (and super cheap at the lab), RA-4 at home is very difficult, it's dreadful to look at and you need to scan it anyway to get shareable or printable results. So these are the extra steps of lab (less convenient than home) and scanning. And the result is usually worse than APS-C digital. So why bother? Shoot BW/E-6 on film cameras, shoot digital when color and flexibility matter. Just no special feelings - it makes me feel so numb.

So I have a large stockpile of black and white film, and a bunch of slide film for special occassions. Maybe I can skip C-41.

# One step closer

At the beginning was surprisingly easy. It's only the promises of new stocks - Chinese Aerocolor III or Harman Phoenix - that made me briefly reconsider. Most of my photography was black and white, and while I was sometimes missing color, I still have done decently, I believe.

Over time, slide film went up in price significantly in price with rumors of Provia getting discontinued. On top of that, I lost the contacts from Poland with ultra cheap expired or slow duplication slide. That's one main thing. Black and white... is black and white. It does get boring. When I got into shooting 6x12 landscapes at blue hour, I only could shoot slide on the big camera, and nothing really on the smaller formats.

With slide film prices, even with respooled E100D (80CNY + 60HKD for dev), I wouldn't shoot slide in HK (not special enough anymore), but I haven't traveled outside much either. And digital doesn't feel the same, as silly as it sounds. Simple as. I'd bring it for jobs or travel, yes, however my everyday carry was a film camera. It's just about the tactile experience, the sounds, moving the levers etc. Very vapid, but I'm not ashamed to admit it.

# Breaking the habit

So when I got that Phoenix roll and put it into my trusty Minolta XD-7, I realized a trivial truth: using these cameras is just fun. And color negative allows you to use them with decent color results, with more flexibility than slide. Yeah, it's more steps. These steps are enjoyable (discounting development, scanning, and editing). Just another way to experience moving the advance lever, focusing, with little help from automated systems.

_I was really BUSy, sorry for the late review; taken with the MD 100mm 2.5_

It's as simple as that. And I stubbornly discounted the color negative. I think if E-6 was more accessible, I would stand by it, but the numbers don't lie - you can get Chinastill or Aerocolor for 50-55CNY a roll, development is 25-30HKD. And the results are interesting - when I saw the scans from Phoenix, I realized that while I could achieve that look digitally, I probably wouldn't bother - I'm a fan of sharp realism in the digital realm.

# Harman Phoenix: Cure for the itch?

Scanned it with X-S10, 7a 60 2.8 macro, the Chinese scanning setup, on PC from C1 to G2P to LR. G2P did a decent job dealing with the colors, I think. I set the conversion to "extra" (for "difficult" films).

I rated it at 125, from reviews I've read before. It's... grainy, pretty low on detail. Halation does bother me, maybe it's not as strong as Chinastill, but I would rather not have it at all. In short, I wouldn't shoot it again, if I can get Aerocolor. This ends the review.

_And some with the 50 1.4. It ain't a film for landscapes, or night; about right for documenting pieces of shit blasting music._

No, really. It's obviously not as realistic in color reproduction like professional, or even amateur Kodak or Fuji films. I'm terribly late with that review anyway and everyone who wanted to shoot it, shot it already, and I cannot add much to it. This is more of an excuse to talk about C-41-less experience.

_Colors can be quite alright, as they pop on the drying baskets._

I do enjoy the photos, but my attention will move onto other color films. Wish Harman luck with their color film business, and hope that they can release a competitive product at some point, rather than a novelty.
